## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the INTO THE DEEP (2024-2025) competition season.

## Welcome!
This repo contains all the code for our Into the Deep robot, HYDRA. Take a look, and feel free to cringe at abominable commit messages, undocumented code, random magic numbers in auto, and some really wack state machines. (I'll clean it up later, trust)

## Notable Features
- Sample tracking via Limelight Vision
- Automated claw orientation
- Command-based system

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later.

## Libraries
Along with the FTC SDK, we use [PedroPathing](https://pedropathing.com) for localization and autonomous pathing and [FTCLib](https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib) for command-based programming and control loops.
